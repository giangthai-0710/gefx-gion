=================

This is the first entry in the GeFX plugin collection: GiON â€“ a versatile distortion plugin capable of delivering anything from a clean, transparent boost to intense distortion and gritty fuzz. It was heavily insprired by the ingenious Kernom Ridge and the Mood control.

Getting GiON
============

You can download GiON [here](https://github.com/giangthai-0710/gefx-gion/releases/tag/v1.0.0). As of now, only VST3 is supported.

Using GiON is very simple: Just open a DAW of your choice, select GiON from the plugin list and **CRUNCH!**

Using GiON
==========

Parameters
----------
- **Crunch**: Changes the hardness of the distortion applied - GiON's take on the Mood control. At the default **Stage** control, it can seamlessly transition from light overdrive to a very mild distortion.
- **Gain**: Increases the input volume, which increases the amount of distortion applied.
- **Volume**: Increases the output volume.
- **Pre bass**: Increases the amount of bass **before** distortion. This will cause the bass frequencies to distort more.
- **Pre mid**: Increases the amount of mids **before** distortion. 
- **Pre treb**: Increases the amount of treble **before** distortion.
- **Post bass**: Increases the amount of bass **after** distortion. This will not affect how the bass frequencies are distorted.
- **Post mid**: Increases the amount of mids **after** distortion.
- **Post treb**: Increases the amount of treble **after** distortion.
- **Stage**: Changes the behavior of the **Crunch** control, allows it to go from distortion to fuzz.
- **Bypass**: Bypasses the effect.
